 # Question 4
 
 Imagine you are creating an app to track food usage in the LCS Dining Hall to help reduce food waste.
 
 The kitchen staff and TOD will use your app to track the following information:
 
 * Diners: the total number of people who ate at a single meal
 * Salad bar: the total quantity of salad bar items consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Soup: the total volume of soup consumed by mass (in litres)
 * Main course: the total mass of main course (hot items) consumed by mass (in kilograms)
 * Pizza oven: the total mass of items consumed that were made in the pizza oven, by mass (in kilograms)
 * Date: The date of the meal (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 * Time frame: The time frame of the meal (e.g.: 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM)
 
 Declare constants for each of these items, **but be sure to choose the appropriate data type in each case**.
 
 Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for each constant.

// Answer question 4 below
var totalNumberOfDiners = 350
print("The total number of diners always change in every each day. Someday it could be 350 people, someday it could be more, or some day it could be less.")
var totalQuantityOfsaladBar = 50
print("The total quantity of saladbar always change in every each day, too. Every day we have different salad bar items so every day the mass of salad bar is different.")
var totalVolumeOfSoup = 30
print("Same reason as the total quantity of salad bar. Every day we have different type of soups and the weight would be vary.")
var totalMassOfMainCourse = 60
print("Same reason as total volume of soup.")
var totalMassByPizzaOven = 45
print("Same reason as total volume of soup.")
let theDateOfTheMeal = "Monday, January 22, 2018"
print("Even though total number of diners, total quantity of salad bar, total volume of soup, total mass of main course, or total mass by pizza oven change, the specific date for each day is always constant.")
let timeFrame = "5:30 PM to 7:00 PM"
print("No matter how did other terms change, our supper time is always 5:30 pm to 7:00 pm. It never changed.")

 ### Learning Goals - Programming
 
 * Goal 2
    * *Thinking*
        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.
